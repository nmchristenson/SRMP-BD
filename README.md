Brown dwarf code and diagrams
This code was from my time as a high school intern in the Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC. 
I worked on a team of three students on an astrophysics project about spectral typing brown dwarfs. 
This is a project I worked on over 7 years ago,=; I am archiving it as a nice reminder of where my interest in physics truly began!
