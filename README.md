This project was from my time as a high school intern in the Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) at the American Museum of Natural History in NYC. 
I worked on a team of three students on an astrophysics project about spectral typing brown dwarfs with high proper motion. 
This is a project I worked on over 6 years ago; I am archiving it as a nice reminder of the beginning of my research career!
